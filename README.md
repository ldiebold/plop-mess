# plop-mess
This is a plop file I used to use to quickly add new models to my application at work!

## I don't use plop anymore!
These days, I use Hygen. I work on large projects, and have found hygen is much easier to scale (and not too much harder to learn!)

Also, hygen uses ejs and front matter. I prefer ejs to handlebars.

Having said that, I still think plop is wonderful, and may well be a better choice for smaller projects AND... You have to make a lot of the decisions about how the code is structured yourself. Some people love that!

## This is just a reference
Only use this as a reference/guide. It's probably not even worth forking!

Have fun :smile:
